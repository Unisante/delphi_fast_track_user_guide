::: callout-tip
If table captions and/or tables are on next page, it is probably because of paragraph formatting:

-   select caption or table and go to Paragraph \> Line and Page Breaks tab (Encha√Ænements in french)

-   uncheck **Widow/Orphan control** (Eviter veuves et orphelins) and **Page break before** (Paragraphes solidaires)
