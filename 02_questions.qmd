# Types of questions {#sec-understand-type-of-questions}

There are three types of questions in a *fast-track Delphi* process. Their structure and implications for the analysis and reporting are described below. Round 2 (dft2) will include all three types of question, while round 3 (dft3) should in principle include only type 1 questions.

Detailed rationale for the methodology can be found in [publications](#sec-publications).

We suggest you read the following paragraphs to understand the outputs that will be produced for each type of question, before going further in your project.

## Type 1 question {#sec-type-1-question}

They are Likert questions. Experts express their opinion by rating their level of agreement with an affirmative statement on a scale from 1 (complete disagreement) to 9 (complete agreement).

-   For each statement, the code produces a statistical (median, interquartile \[IQR\] and minimum-maximum ranges) and a graphical (barplot and boxplot) summary. The number of respondents is also indicated, with percent of total respondents.

-   A green tick indicates that an agreement and/or a consensus was reached at the group level (see thresholds in @sec-agreement-and-consensus-thresholds).

-   For individualised result reports, the expert's answer is displayed in digits (column 'your answers') and on the graphical summary of group response distribution.

-   All type 1 questions of a given section are summarised in one unique table. Below is an example (in French) of the output for one statement of one individualised result report.

## Type 2 question {#sec-type-2-question}

They are multiple choice questions with one possible response, that aim at clarifying experts' topical propositions and orienting future statements. "No opinion" is always proposed as a choice option.

-   For each question, the code produces a statistical (number of responses for each option with percent of total respondents) and graphical display of group responses.

-   A green tick indicates that an agreement was reached for one or several particular answer options (see thresholds in @sec-agreement-and-consensus-thresholds).

-   Answer options are automatically sorted by descending frequency of responses ("No opinion" always appearing at the bottom).

-   For individualised result reports, the expert's answer is indicated by a red cross (column 'your answer').

-   Each type 2 question is summarised in a separate table. Below is an example (in French) of the output for one type 2 question of one individualised result report.

## Type 3 question {#sec-type-3-question}

They are multiple choice questions with up to three answer options, that aim at precising experts' topical propositions and orienting future statements. "No opinion" is always proposed as a choice option.

![Example of a type 3 question (statement #2) as structured in the REDCap e-questionnaire (in French) - @sec-instructions-for-redcap will guide you through the creation of this type of question within your REDCap project.](_img/Question_type3_redcap.jpg){#fig-redcap-type3 fig-align="center"}

-   For each question, the code produces a statistical (number of responses for each option with percent of total respondents) and graphical display of group responses.

-   A green tick indicates that an agreement was reached for one or several particular answer options (see thresholds in @sec-agreement-and-consensus-thresholds). Answer options are automatically sorted by descending frequency of responses ("No opinion" always appearing at the bottom).

-   For individualised result reports, the expert's answers are indicated by red crosses (column 'your answers').

-   Each type 3 question is summarised in a particular table. Below is an example (in French) of the output for one type 3 question of one individualised result report.

## Comments {#sec-comments}

Participants can leave comments after each question (for all types). They are very useful to prepare statement reformulations for round 3 and refine key messages at the end of round 3.

## Agreement and consensus thresholds {#sec-agreement-and-consensus-thresholds}

We defined the following thresholds based on the literature and a pragmatic approach. These thresholds can be modified in `000_parameters.R`.

-   For type 1 questions

    -   Agreement is defined by the center value of the data (median), and is considered reached when the median is ≥ 7 out of 10 (≤ 3 out of 10 for disagreement considered reached)

    -   Consensus is defined by the dispersion of the data (interquartile range, IQR), and is considered reached when the IQR does not exceed 3 scale points.

-   For type 2 and 3 questions

    -   Agreement is reached when the answer has been selected by ≥ 66% of the respondents.

## Conventions {#sec-conventions}

-   Comments in the R code are preceded by \##

-   Filenames and paths are in `typewriter style`

-   Packages are in **bold** : **data.table**

-   Functions are followed by a () : `fs::dir_tree()`

-   [ ] [.]{style="color:white;"} Run this code ... : actions you need to take to prepare your own project are preceded by a ticking box (not interactive)

The table below summarizes the conventions used in the names of tables and variables.

| section       | \_a\_                   | Section A                      | sections correspond to different aspects of the topic |
