## Pre-requisites

-   [ ] To start your own project, download the [Delphi Fast Track : code only](https://github.com/Unisante) available on GitHub.

-   [ ] Make sure you have done the steps presented in @sec-pre-requisites.


## Create the structure of your project {#sec-create-structure-project}

-   [ ] run `00_run_ME_once_to_create_structure.R`

This will create a predefined set of subfolders within the project folder.

::: callout-warning
If you choose to modify the structure of the project, you will need to revise every path in the R and Rmd files.
:::

## Update parameters {#sec-update-parameters}

-   [ ] open `./code/000_parameters.R` and update as necessary, specially some of the labels

## Update the word templates {#sec-update-word-templates}

This project uses `MS Word` templates in order to build the reports. The autonumbering will be created by [`bookdown`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/).


-   [ ]  update the templates to suit your needs in each subfolder :

    - `../analysis/dft2/template-bookdown.docx`
    
    - `../analysis/dft3/template-bookdown.docx`
    
    - `../analysis/doverall/template_exec_summary_bookdown.docx`

Please refer to the [Officeverse manual](https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/) to see how to do it.

## Update the texts for introduction {#sec-update-texts-introduction}

These texts are word documents with one or two paragraphs, sometimes images that will be inserted at the beginning of the reports. They will be updated in several steps, once some of the results are available.

-   [ ] prepare them in advance to gain time

-   [ ] store them on the server in the folder defined in `./code/000_parameters.R` (called `path_texts_intro_server`).

-   [ ] run `./code/00_update_texts_intro.R`

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
-   Do not leave a blank line at the beginning of the text, nor at the end

-   Headers are not needed in these texts as they will be provided in Rmd files
