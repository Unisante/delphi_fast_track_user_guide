# Overall

Once you have finished with the analysis and reports of round 3, this page will guide you through the steps to publish the final overall report which synthesizes results from round 2 and 3 (statistical and graphical summaries).

## Update summary image {#sec-update-summary-image}

> TODO: upate path for png

-   [ ] Update the image for the executive summary in the `./texts_intro/delphiFT_Overall_FigureFlow.pptx` provided with the details pertaining to your project and save it as `ExecutiveSummary_figure-Flow.png` in the `./analysis/overall/` folder

It summarizes the process with dates, number of experts (participants) and number of statements. See @fig-exec-steps below for an example of this figure using data from the pilot study provided in the demo data (in French).

## Update introductory texts for the executive summary {#sec-update-introductory-texts-for-the-executive-summary}

-   [ ] Update the introductory texts on the server

-   [ ] Run `00_update_texts_intro.R` one more time to update the `*.docx` files in your local directory

## Modify executive summary report titles and details {#sec-modify-executive-summary-report-title}

-   [ ] Open the code `./code/000_parameters.R`

-   [ ] Check and modify if necessary `title_overall`, `subtitle_overall` and `authors_text` 

-   [ ] In section 4 at the end of the code, update the `statement_numbers_in_dft2_to_keep_for_execsummary` (statements numbers like in the chunk below from the demo) that had reached consensual agreement by the end of round 2. They were not re-submitted to participants in round 3, but still need to appear in the executive summary report combining results from round 2 and 3.

    ```{r}

    ## 4. elements for executive summary --------------------------------
    ## . statement_numbers_in_dft2_to_keep_for_execsummary ----
    ## some of the statements of round 2 have been refined in dft3, so are not kept in executive summary
    ## update this line after round 2 is finished
    statement_numbers_in_dft2_to_keep_for_execsummary <- c(4, 11, 18)

    ```

## Publish overall report {#sec-publish-overall-report}

-   [ ] Run `0_run_ME_overall.R`

This code will:

-   update the introductory texts by running `./code/00_update_texts_intro.R`

-   prepare the result tables (only type 1 questions) with combined round 2 and 3 by running `06_prepare_tables_combined_round_2_3.R`

-   publish the overall report (called **Executive summary**) by running `./analysis/overall/overall_executive_summary.Rmd` and saving it as `./output/reports/overall/dft_overall_executive_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.docx`

## Finalise overall report {#sec-finalize-overall-report}

Here are a few tips to be done manually (directly in your Word software) to improve the look and comprehensiveness of your executive summary:

-   [ ] Open the summary report using the Word software

-   [ ] Add the text 'Key messages'

-   [ ] Add the "target" images (`*.png`) in the table headers

-   [ ] If necessary, rearrange the order of the statements within the tables (example: first, statement that have reached consensual agreement by the end of round 2, then those having reached consensual agreement in round 3)

-   [ ] Delete the 'section' column

-   [ ] Adjust the height of the table rows

-   [ ] Delete the table 'Consensual disagreement reached' if none of your statements have reached a consensual disagreement

::: callout-tip
If table captions and/or tables are on next page, it is probably because of paragraph formatting:

-   select caption or table and go to Paragraph \> Line and Page Breaks tab (Enchaînements in french)

-   uncheck **Widow/Orphan control** (Eviter veuves et orphelins) and **Page break before** (Paragraphes solidaires)

... et voilà !

Congratulations for going through all steps of the *fast-track Delphi* process. You are now ready to spread the consensual messages that have been reached by your expert participants. Good luck and enjoy the communication part!
