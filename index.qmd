***WORK in PROGRESS -** check **TODO**s*

## Purpose

This guide gives an overview of the toolkit to conduct a Delphi fast track study (DelphiFT) and the steps suggested for the analysis.

The `Delphi fast-track` was developed by [Unisanté](https://www.unisante.ch/) to provide consensus information for political decisions in context of public health crisis.

Details of the methodology can be found in ...

> ***TODO** : add link to publication in english and french*

The process consists in three rounds of consultation. The participants will be brought together in a first round during which a series of topics/questions/statements will be collected using a nominal group technique (NGT). The participants will then respond individually to questions in the second and third rounds using an online questionnaire build with [**`REDCap`**](https://projectredcap.org/).

In order to produce results in a very short time frame, we use an [R project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html) to analyse the results and produce **editable word documents** :

-   a generic report and individualised reports for the second round (dft2)

-   a generic report and individualised reports for the third round (dft3)

-   an overall executive summary

## Softwares and packages {#sec-software-and-packages}

-   interface and language : [**`RStudio`**](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [**`R Statistical Software`**](https://www.r-project.org/)

-   obtain data : [**`REDCapR`**](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR/) (not necessary for the demo)

-   data management, analysis and visualisation : mainly [**`data.table`**](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/), with some [**`tidyverse`**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and other packages. Regex expressions are sometimes used.

-   reports : [**`officedown`**](https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/officedown-for-word.html) and [**`flextable`**](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/) from the [**`officeverse`**](https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/index.html)

## Conventions {#sec-conventions}

-   Comments in the R code are preceded by \##

-   Filenames and paths are in `typewriter style`

-   Packages are in **bold** : **data.table**

-   Functions are followed by a () : `fs::dir_tree()`

-   Actions are preceded by a ticking box (not interactive):

    -   [ ] run this code ...

The table below summarises the conventions used in the names of tables and variables.

| Word used     | Example as part of name | Example inside a word document | What it means                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| dt            | dt\_                    | \-                             | a data.table                                          |
| current_round | dft2\_ , dft3\_         | \-                             | round 2 or round 3                                    |
| section       | \_a\_                   | Section A                      | sections correspond to different aspects of the topic |
| statement     | \_s1\_                  | Statement 1                    | statement followed by its number                      |
| type          | \_type1                 | type 1                         | type of variable (3 sorts here, see below)            |

::: callout-tip
The easiest way to understand the process and see the output is to download the [demo](https://github.com/Unisante/delphi_ft_demo) and explore it (see Part XXX).
