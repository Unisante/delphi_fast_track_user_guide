    "section": "Purpose",
    "text": "Purpose\nThis guide gives an overview of the toolkit to conduct a fast-track Delphi process (DelphiFT) and the steps for the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe fast-track Delphi is a process developed by Unisanté, aiming to rapidly build consensus among scientific experts on a topical issue in order to support political decisions in a context of public health crisis.\nThe process consists in three rounds of consultation of experts. The experts (participants) are brought together in a first round during which a series of topics/questions/statements are collected and prioritized using an adapted version of the nominal group technique (NGT). The experts then express their opinion on these statements by responding individually to questions in the second and third rounds using an online questionnaire built with REDCap. Rational for the methodology and detailed results of the testing phase can be found in publications.\nIn order to produce results in a very short time frame, we developed an R project that connects with REDCap to download and process the data, and produce result reports in an editable word document format:\n\na generic report and individualised reports for the second round (dft2)\na generic report and individualised reports for the third round (dft3)\nan overall executive summary\n\n\n\nWe suggest you first discover the demo to understand what you will produce, using the fast-track Delphi: code with demo data and results available on GitHub (see also Chapter 3)\nTo start your own project, download the fast-track Delphi: code only available on GitHub and follow this user guide."

You should do this twice (once for each round)\nGive a name to your projects: DelphiFT project_name round 2 and DelphiFT project_name round 3, respectively (replace project_name by your project name)\nWithin each of these REDCap projects, manage the access rights to suit your team’s needs by modifying access parameters on the ‘Users Rights’ Menu (left side on your REDCap project page)\n\nYou should then familiarize with the proposed structure, which is the following:\n\nFor round 2:\n\nOne foreword section containing 6 fields aiming at describing your panel of experts (the email field is MANDATORY - do not remove or modify it!)\nOne ‘preamble’ section (Z) containing one type 1 question (4 fields), one type 2 question (2 fields) and one type 3 question (6 fields)\nThree sections (A, B and C) containing each two questions of each type\n\nFor round 3:\n\nOne foreword section containing 1 field aiming at collecting experts’ email (MANDATORY - do not remove it!)\nOne ‘preamble’ section (Z) containing three type 1 question\nThree sections (A, B and C) containing each three type 1 question\n\n\nThis structure is of course subject to modifications to suit your needs in due time, i.e., when you have created the statement content of the e-questionnaire based on the results of the previous round (see the start of Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 for REDCap management during rush periods of rounds 2 and 3, respectively).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe strongly suggest you try duplicating any type 1, 2 and 3 question in your REDCap project, and test the e-questionnaire, so you are prepared doing it efficiently in a rush period.\nWhen duplicating a question, you must duplicate ALL fields that belong to this question - and update their variable name and branching logic accordingly:\n\nA type 1 question contains 4 fields (one matrix field, one simple field, one embedding field, and one field for comments)\nA type 2 question contains 2 fields (one simple field, and one field for comments)\nA type 3 question contains 6 fields (two simple fields, one embedding field, two fields for message parameters, and one field for comments)"

You are now ready to spread the consensual messages that have been reached by your expert participants. Good luck and enjoy the communication part!"
