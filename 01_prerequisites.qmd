# Pre-requisites {#sec-pre-requisites}

To start using the toolkit for your *fast-track Delphi* project, you will need to:

-   install RStudio and R - see [Hands-On Programming with R - Appendix A](https://jjallaire.github.io/hopr/a1-starting.html)

-   get some packages - see below

-   create a [**`REDCap`**](https://projectredcap.org/) project and the token to access it through the R project - see @sec-instructions-for-redcap

::: callout-tip
We strongly suggest you also go through @sec-understand-type-of-questions to understand the structure of the types of questions and how they are considered by the code for analysis and reporting. The demo we offer with this user guide (see @sec-demo) is also useful to explore before starting your own project.

## Get some packages {#sec-get-some-packages}

You will need to run the following *chunks (lines of executable code)*

-   [ ] Install pacman unless you already have it : simpler to call libraries and keep them up-to-date

    ``` r
    ## install it if not already there
    if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") 
    ```

-   [ ] Load the following packages with `pacman::p_load` (it will 1. install package if not installed and keep it up-to-date, 2. call the library)

    ``` r
    pacman::p_load(
        bookdown,
        crayon,
        data.table,
        flextable,
        formattable,
        fs,
        ftExtra,
        ggplot2,
        haven,
        here,
        magrittr,
        officedown,
        patchwork,
        purrr,
        REDCapR,
        sjlabelled,
        sjmisc,
        sjPlot,
        stringr,
        tidyverse,
        writexl)

    ## install.packages("remotes") ## If it's not already installed.
    remotes::install_github("OuhscBbmc/OuhscMunge")
    ```

-   [ ] Install [fast-track Delphi: code only](https://github.com/Unisante/delphi-fast-track)


    ``` r
    Download as a zip file (click on green button Code), and unzip locally
      or
    remotes::install_github("Unisante/delphi-fast-track") 
    ```
